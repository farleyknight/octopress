# You can't stand in GUI-land forever..

As much as there are plenty of graphical tools for developers, there are plenty of tight spots that require use of the command line. For example, logging into an SSH server means that unless you use a VPN to handle desktop interaction, you're stuck with the command line. Also, if you're using any of the common command line tools, such as git, it's helpful to stay in the command line and continue doing your work.

Furthermore, all programs are just text. Being able to stick with a simple text interface means that you don't have to do context switching in your workflow, which is one of the more expensive operations to deal with (and also why programmers hate interruptions!).
